**Meta Prompt: Expanding CaPE → CaPSim for Mixture Classification**

I am working on a Raman spectroscopy-based identification system, specifically for SERS spectra. So far, I have developed a method to classify a *single unknown query spectrum* using a known Raman reference library. This method is based on the 2023 paper by Halas et al., and follows the CaPE (Characteristic Peak Extraction) → CaPSim (Characteristic Peak Similarity) pipeline. It involves:

* Preprocessing (baseline correction, smoothing, L2 normalization),
* Extracting top N peaks (CaPE) with windows (w\_max = 36),
* Representing spectra via max-pooled feature vectors,
* Computing similarity using a dot product (CaPSim),
* Identifying the best match based on the highest similarity score.

I now want to explore how to extend this method to classify *mixtures* of two or more analytes within a single SERS spectrum.

### My constraints:

* I want to retain interpretability and simplicity if possible (prefer traditional ML).
* I do not have large datasets per chemical (few reference spectra per class).
* Ideally, I want to reuse the existing CaPE → CaPSim foundation.

### In this chat, help me:

1. Identify methods that can adapt or extend the CaPE → CaPSim workflow for mixture deconvolution.
2. Explore unsupervised and semi-supervised strategies (e.g., NMF, ICA, sparse coding).
3. Suggest explainable machine learning techniques for resolving mixture components.
4. Recommend relevant papers that fully describe their algorithms (not black boxes).
5. Propose a roadmap for implementing a working system on real SERS mixture data.

Please ground all suggestions in Raman-specific literature or domain-relevant practices.
