# ATLAS SERS research

This directory is the public, data-free execution scaffold for the ATLAS
multi-instrument SERS study. The study asks whether acquisition-aware deep
representations improve chemical identification when the test instrument and
physical samples are absent from model fitting.

The repository contains methods, contracts, registries, tests, and figure
specifications. It intentionally contains no spectra, row-level metadata,
derived feature arrays, fitted models, or local source paths.

## Scientific direction

The primary comparison is a leakage-controlled, station-conditioned,
source-only unseen-instrument evaluation:

1. establish rigorously tuned classical chemometric and machine-learning
   baselines;
2. train a compact acquisition-aware one-dimensional encoder;
3. compare the methods on identical physical-master-grouped partitions;
4. measure domain-balanced performance, calibration, robustness, and nuisance
   predictability; and
5. route the paper according to predefined evidence gates, including a valid
   classical-only or negative deep-learning result.

VAE and disentanglement analyses remain diagnostic. Without paired clean
chemical spectra or factorial chemical/nuisance interventions, reconstruction
must not be described as denoising and latent factors must not be interpreted
as causal chemical/nuisance separation.

The full locked analysis specification is in [plan/MASTER_PLAN.md](plan/MASTER_PLAN.md).
For quick browsing, open [plan/index.html](plan/index.html) locally.

See [REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md](REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md) for module
boundaries, artifact flow, and implementation order.

## Private data boundary

Set `ATLAS_PRIVATE_ROOT` to a directory outside the Git checkout. Code must
read immutable inputs from that location and write generated outputs under an
ignored local artifact root. Never copy source spectra into this directory.

```bash
export ATLAS_PRIVATE_ROOT=/path/outside/the/repository/atlas_inputs
```

The expected private files and their frozen checksums are identified in
`plan/contracts/research_contract.json`. Their contents are not published.

## Quick start

From this directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_public_scaffold.py
python3 -m pip install -e '.[dev,viz]'
pytest
```

Install the `deep` extra only for neural experiments:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e '.[deep]'
```

The scaffold deliberately does not launch experiments yet. Implement phases
in the order recorded by `plan/registries/phase_registry.csv`, and do not begin
confirmatory evaluation until the corresponding decision gate is satisfied.

## Reproducibility rules

- Split by physical `master_sample_id`; spectrum rows are not independent.
- Fit preprocessing, feature selection, calibration, and thresholds on the
  permitted training roles only.
- Keep zero-shot, unlabeled adaptation, paired calibration, and supervised
  few-shot regimes separate.
- Preserve failed and collapsed neural runs in denominators.
- Save row-level predictions privately and publish only disclosure-approved
  aggregate tables.
- Generate every scientific figure as native TikZ/PGFPlots and standalone
  self-contained HTML from the same frozen aggregate table.

## Status

The research plan is execution-ready but is not a prospective preregistration:
pilot results informed its design. Definitive model implementations and result
artifacts are intentionally absent from this initial scaffold.
